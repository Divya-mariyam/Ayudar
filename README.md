<b> SYNOPSIS </b>

<!-- ABSTRACT OF THE PROJECT -->
 Ayudar is a mobile application which can be used to detect learning disabilities in children and provide further assistance in their treatment. Children of the age 6 and above have mainly three types of learning disabilities. They are :
         Dyslexia-Disability to identify letters,
         Dyscalculia-Mathematical problem,
         Dysgraphia-Forming letters.

Most of these disorders are characterized by troubles with social interaction, and communication and by restricted and repetitive behaviour. Inappropriate social interaction, learning disability, intense interact upon limited number of things, depression, anxiety etc. are the main symptoms of child disability. Parents may find difficult to find out disability in the earlier stage of their children, so this application will be helpful to overcome this difficulty. Disabilities are identified through surveys and games. Results of these games and surveys are then forwarded to a particular doctor, parents choose at the time of registration. They will assist the children by providing consultation tips, messages for better treatment. Hence, parents can identify learning disabilities in their children and can be diagnosed in the early stage itself.
